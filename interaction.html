    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>It’s a networking site for the school, where students and faculties can get to know each other and interact. It acts as guidance for the new students to get to know his/her school better and to get familiarized with faculties and other activities. We are creating a “Social Networking Platform” for the university. We started the assignment by identifying the entities who would use our system. Then, we started identifying the relationships between those entities. Later, we discussed the multiplicity in the relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many. We introduced subclass relationship to hold entity specific attributes and the parent class held common attributes. We also had discussion if we had a weak entity in E-R Diagram.<p>
     <ul>
  <li>•Graph in E-R diagram to build relationship;</li>
  <li>•Using SQL to store all the information in the Oracle database;</li>
  <li>•Data access by JDBI/SQL/JDBC;</li>
  <li>•BackEnd: Java and Dropwizard as framework;</li>
  <li>•FrontEnd: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap create view, JavaScrip/JQuery as Model/Controller.</li>
</ul>
